                <h1>About this this Project</h1>
                <p>Covered is a WebApp, with the intention to make it as easy as possible to customize your Steam Library with your Favorite Covers. Therefore it uses the Steam API to access your Game Library and give you recommendations on which games you could be interested in. Then it goes to search the Covered Database to look for Covers for those games. If it doesnt find any Covers it will try to find some Covers through the <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/api/v2/">SteamGridDB API</a>. It will then present you the Covers it found and you can select, which one you like the best. As soon as you'r finished with this process, you can Download a ZIP file, containing all Game Covers. You only have to paste those files into the Steam LibraryCache Folder.</p>

                <h2>Credit</h2>
